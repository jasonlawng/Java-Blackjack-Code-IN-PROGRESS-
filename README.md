# *In-Progress* Java Blackjack Code

I found inspiration for a blackjack game made in java while on Thanksgiving break. Me and my sister were talking about an old friend of ours who went to middle school with her.
Apparently, he dropped out of high school to become a professional Poker player and I guess it made me want to create this simple Blackjack program.

This serves as another example to show potential students in the future of cool things they can do with code.
The project is still in progress so when I get a chance I'll definitely need to lower the amount of if-else statements and replace them with method calls. I plan on putting this on a website in the future with a GUI and everything, which'll be exciting.
